= Mounting Repeaters =

Mounting repeaters securely is critical for good performance and long-term reliability.  
The goal is always to place the antenna as high as possible with clear line-of-sight, while ensuring the mount can withstand wind and weather.

'''Remember: Height is might — the higher the node, the better connection you will get to the mesh.'''

== Mounting Options ==

=== 1. Pole Mount ===
The most common method is using a standard pole and clamp system.  
* Simple to set up with widely available hardware.  
* Can be attached to an existing mast, tower, or sturdy pole.  
* Best suited for permanent installations where height and stability are required.

=== 2. Gutter Mount ===
Community member '''Aussiemandias''' designed a specialized 3D printable gutter mount for quick and discreet repeater installation.  
* Ideal for residential areas where pole mounting isn’t practical.  
* Attaches directly to house gutters without the need for drilling into walls.  
* Provides a stable base while keeping the antenna elevated.

=== 3. Vent Pipe Extension Mount ===

* Standard 3 foot ABS pipe from Home Depot, 3" in diameter.
* ABS cement on the one side attached to the extension and on the side attached to the house two self-tapping screws in both sides as a safety measure, which allows removal in the future.

== Notes ==
* Regardless of mount type, always ensure the mount and fasteners are weather-rated and can handle local wind conditions.  
* Periodically inspect mounts for wear, corrosion, or loosening.  
* These options are specifically for the recommended solar repeater build, linked here: [[Hardware/Repeaters#Solar_Node_–_Recommended_Enclosure|Solar Node – Recommended Enclosure]].
