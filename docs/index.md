## About
Welcome to the Ottawa mesh group!
See the info below for default frequencies, and please join our Discord to chat with us.

Both **MeshCore** and **Meshtastic** are protocols that run on top of LoRa radios.
LoRa (Long Range) is a low-power modulation suited to long-distance links at modest data rates.
By building on LoRa, both systems enable decentralized, low-cost community networks.

Most of the city is currently running **MeshCore** with some **Meshtastic** presence scattered around.
We have roughly **50 static MeshCore repeaters** around the region, linking Carleton Place, Ashton, Stittsville,
Kemptville, Kanata, Barrhaven, Westboro, Downtown, Old Ottawa South, Vanier, Orléans, and areas near Cumberland.

## MeshCore vs Meshtastic
**Meshtastic** is a peer-to-peer mesh where every node can forward traffic, making it flexible for ad-hoc use but prone to congestion in larger networks.  
Because it relies on nodes that are typically moving, coverage can also be unreliable and sporadic.  

**MeshCore** relies on fixed repeaters for routing, providing a more stable and scalable backbone for city-wide coverage.

## MeshCore
To get started and connect to the mesh, begin with a **companion node**.  
Pick a build that fits your needs, then flash MeshCore companion firmware to the device.  

From there, you can explore repeaters builds and mounting options to expand coverage and strengthen the Ottawa mesh.
