## About the Community

We’re a community of hobbyists, builders, and experimenters collaborating to build a decentralized long-range communications network across the National Capital Region in Eastern Ontario and Western Quebec.

**MeshCore** runs on top of LoRa radios.  
LoRa (Long Range) is a low-power, long-distance radio modulation ideal for community networks, sensors, emergency use, and experimentation.

Across the NCR and the surrounding area we currently operate over **50 static MeshCore repeaters**

Whether you want to experiment, build hardware, climb towers, or just connect with other enthusiasts — you’re welcome here.

## MeshCore vs Meshtastic

### **MeshCore**

MeshCore is a **repeater-driven city network**, designed for stability and wide-area coverage.

- Fixed repeaters form a reliable backbone  
- Consistent routing and low congestion  
- Ideal for city-scale deployments  
- Great for hobbyists who want predictable, always-on connectivity

### **Meshtastic**

Meshtastic is a **peer-to-peer mesh** where every node can forward traffic.

- Flexible and great for small groups or field use  
- Best for mobile, temporary, or low-density setups  
- Can become congested in dense urban deployments  
- Coverage varies depending on who is online and nearby

## Getting Started With MeshCore

### Pick a Companion Node

Start by picking a device from our recommended list:  
**[Recommended Companions](hardware/recommended-companions.md)**

Your companion node is how you join the Ottawa mesh. It connects you directly into the MeshCore network.

With it, you can:

- Talk with others on the MeshCore mesh  
- Discover which repeaters are in range  
- Learn how the network routes your messages  
- Join in on testing, experiments, and enjoy exploring the mesh  

It's the easiest way to get started before moving on to repeaters or solar builds.
