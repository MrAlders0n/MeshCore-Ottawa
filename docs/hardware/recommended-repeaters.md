# Repeaters

Repeaters form the stable backbone of the Ottawa MeshCore network.  
You can choose between **pre-built repeaters** or **DIY builds**, and both are great options.  

Pre-built units have improved a lot in reliability and price, while DIY builds remain popular for those who like full control over their hardware.

## Important Note for RAK-Based Repeaters

If you plan to use a **RAK** board for a repeater, you must update it to the **OTAFIX bootloader firmware**.  
Without this fix, if an OTA update fails over BLE, the repeater will enter an unusable state and require physical access to recover.

Download the OTAFIX firmware:  
**[OTAFIX Bootloader UF2 File](https://github.com/oltaco/Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader_OTAFIX/releases/download/0.9.2-otafix1/update-wiscore_rak4631_board_bootloader-0.9.2-otafix1_nosd.uf2)**

## Pre-Built

These options come fully assembled; simply flash MeshCore and mount them in a high location to expand the mesh.

We recommend upgrading the antenna for best performance. Ideally, use an **N-Type connector** and upgrade to at least the **ALFA AOA-915-5ACM**.

**Note:** These pre-built repeaters have not been thoroughly tested by the Ottawa community, though we have seen other communities report good results.

### Pre-Built Repeater Options

!!! warning "Important SenseCAP Solar Node P1 Pro Note"
    Make sure to order an **RP-SMA → N-Type coax cable** with the device.  
    **Do not accidentally buy SMA — you specifically need RP-SMA.**  
    Seeed uses RP-SMA for the P1 for some reason, and the wrong connector will not fit.  
    With the correct cable, you can upgrade to a proper **Alfa antenna**, which performs significantly better than the included one.
