# Ottawa Repeater Showcase

This page highlights several of the most prominent MeshCore repeater installations across the Ottawa region.  
These nodes form much of the city’s *backbone layer*: long-range, high-reliability repeaters that bridge neighbourhoods and anchor the wider mesh.

Photos, technical notes, and installation details are provided for each site.
