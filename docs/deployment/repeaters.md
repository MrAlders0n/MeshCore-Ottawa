# Overview

<!-- The repeater tables and ID list on this page are automatically generated from meshcore/data/repeaters.yml. 
     To add a new repeater, simply append it to that YAML file — MkDocs will populate the tables automatically. -->

This page lists all deployed and reserved repeater IDs in Ottawa, along with their current configurations.
