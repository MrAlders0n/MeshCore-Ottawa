# MeshCore Frequency Settings
MeshCore developers have published recommended frequency settings that balance performance and avoid congestion in the ISM band, which is often busy with IoT devices such as smart meters.  
Ottawa follows the new recommended defaults for US/CAN.

**Ottawa MeshCore Settings:**  
* **Frequency:** 910.525 MHz 
* **Bandwidth:** 62.5 kHz 
* **Spreading Factor (SF):** 7 
* **Coding Rate (CR):** 5  

All nodes in Ottawa should use these settings.
