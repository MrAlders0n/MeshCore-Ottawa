## Antenna Recommendation
Almost every LoRa device ships with a very basic factory antenna that performs poorly.  
The Ottawa mesh community has tested many replacements, and the following antenna is highly recommended as a reliable upgrade:

## Pre-Built
This is the easiest way to get started — buy a companion node, flash it with MeshCore, and join the mesh.  

We still recommend you buy one of the antennas listed above, as most manufacturers ship poorly tuned antennas with their devices.  

This is a **companion node** and requires a smartphone.  
The MeshCore app connects to the node over Bluetooth (BLE) and is used to send and receive messages on the mesh.  

The following pre-built companion nodes are popular and widely available:

| ThinkNode M1
| Compact device powered by the nRF52840 with a 1.54" screen and GPS support.  
Designed as a ready-to-use companion node for reliable messaging and tracking.

|-
| LilyGO T-Echo
| Compact device with onboard display and GPS.  
Good option for those who want something ready to use with minimal setup.  

**Note:** Buy the non-flashed version and save yourself a few dollars — it’s easy to load MeshCore firmware using the web flasher.

|-
| SenseCAP T1000-E
| A slim card-style tracker device from SeeedStudio.  
Portable and simple form factor (also IP65-rated) — easy to carry as a personal node.

**Note:** The range on this device is more limited than other nodes because it uses built-in antennas.

|-
| RAK WisMesh Tag
| Rugged, compact device with integrated GPS and antennas.  
1000mAh battery, IP66 waterproof/dustproof enclosure, and pre-flashed firmware for instant use.  
Built for reliable off-grid tracking and messaging.

**Note:** The range on this device is more limited than other nodes because it uses built-in antennas.

## Build Your Own
For hobbyists who like to source parts and assemble their own node, here’s an example Ottawa-friendly build (antenna not included here, see above recommendation):  

We still recommend you buy one of the antennas listed above, as most manufacturers ship poorly tuned antennas with their devices.  

This is a **companion node** and requires a smartphone.  

The MeshCore app connects to the node over Bluetooth (BLE) and is used to send and receive messages on the mesh.

''Approximate total cost (excluding antenna): $58.18 CAD''  

Take a peek at [Alley Cat’s models](https://www.printables.com/@AlleyCat/models) — they’re excellent 3D-printable cases for custom companion node builds.

## Standalone Nodes
There are standalone devices such as the **T-Deck**, but we recommend starting with a companion node instead.  
Standalone units are generally more expensive, their user interface is not as polished as the mobile app, and they still have quirks and limitations that can make them challenging for beginners.  

We still recommend you buy one of the antennas listed above, as most manufacturers ship poorly tuned antennas with their devices.  

Below are some standalone devices available:

| LilyGO T-LORA Pager
| A compact standalone LoRa messaging device styled like a classic pager.  
Useful for simple off-grid communication without needing a smartphone.
| [Link](https://lilygo.cc/en-ca/products/t-lora-pager)
|-
| LilyGO T-Deck Plus
| Updated version of the T-Deck with improved specs and refinements.  
Designed with Meshtastic/MeshCore in mind for better performance and usability.  

However, the built-in trackball is considered a huge letdown — many users find it frustrating to use.
