# MeshCore Packet Capture (Standalone Repeater Listener)


This guide explains how to install and run a **custom build of MeshCore repeater firmware** on a **HeltekV3** to act as a standalone packet capture device that forwards logs directly to [analyzer.letsme.sh](https://analyzer.letsme.sh).  
This setup does **not** require a Raspberry Pi, VM, or companion node.

## Overview
This firmware was compiled from [agessaman/MeshCore (mqtt-bridge-implementation-dev)](https://github.com/agessaman/MeshCore/tree/mqtt-bridge-implementation-dev) to simplify setup for the community.

* **Default Frequency:** USA/CAN recommended settings pre-configured  
* **Role:** Repeater with repeat disabled (acts as a “silent repeater” for packet capture)

Each unit functions like a repeater that does not forward packets.  
To avoid ID collisions, each device must have a unique private key.  
Please share your assigned ID in the **Ottawa Mesh Discord** so we can track it.

## Scope
This setup covers packet capture from a standalone repeater node only.  
If you wish to run a full repeater, simply skip the step where repeat is disabled.

## Requirements
* Heltek V3 board  
* USB-C cable  
* Wi-Fi network access  
* Basic familiarity with the [MeshCore Flasher](https://flasher.meshcore.co.uk) tool  

## Firmware Installation
1. **Download the HeltekV3 MQTT Repeater Firmware:** [Link](https://drive.proton.me/urls/BAM30S5MJ0#u6tQH2mlsoZR)  

2. Go to [MeshCore Flasher](https://flasher.meshcore.co.uk/) and click **HeltekV3**  

3. Select **Repeater**  

4. Click **Erase Device**  

5. Click **Flash**  

6. Flashing will take a minute; if it fails, restart at step 2 and try again.  

7. Return to [MeshCore Flasher](https://flasher.meshcore.co.uk/) and scroll to the bottom.  

8. Click **Custom Firmware**  

9. Select the HeltekV3 MQTT Repeater firmware you downloaded in step 1.  

10. **Do NOT click Erase Device** — if you erase here, the firmware will not boot.  

11. Click **Flash** again.  

12. Wait for flashing to complete.  

## Configure Device Identity
1. Visit [[MeshCore/Repeaters & Coverage|Ottawa Repeater ID List]] and choose an unused 2-digit ID.  

2. Open [mc-keygen](https://gessaman.com/mc-keygen/) and enter that ID into the **Repeater ID** field, then click **Generate Key**.  

3. Scroll down and copy the value under **Private Key**.  

4. Open [MeshCore Flasher](https://flasher.meshcore.co.uk/), click **Console**, and select the serial device for your repeater.  

5. Run the following command, replacing <code>&lt;PRIVATE-KEY&gt;</code> with your generated key:  
<pre>
set prv.key <PRIVATE-KEY>
</pre>

6. Configure the repeater name using the Ottawa naming convention (<code>YOW_&lt;Location&gt;</code>):  
<pre>
set name YOW_OldBarrhaven
</pre>

7. Configure the IATA Code for MQTT ingestion
<pre>
set mqtt.iata YOW
</pre>

8. Disable repeat:  
<pre>
set repeat off
</pre>

9. (Optional) Configure ownership info for the Packet Analyzer:  
<div style="margin-left:1em;">
You must have an account on [analyzer.letsme.sh](https://analyzer.letsme.sh/) (login uses MeshCore Forum authentication).  
</div>
<pre>
set mqtt.owner <Companion-Public-Key>
set mqtt.email <MeshCore-Fourm-Email-Address>
</pre>

## Configure Wi-Fi & Timezone
1. Set Wi-Fi credentials:  
<pre>
set wifi.ssid <WIFI-NETWORK-NAME>
set wifi.pwd <WIFI-PASSWORD>
</pre>

2. Set timezone:  
<pre>
set timezone America/Toronto
</pre>

3. Reboot the device:  
<pre>
reboot
</pre>

## Validation
After the device reboots and connects to Wi-Fi, it should automatically start sending logs to the Analyzer MQTT broker.  

1. Go to [analyzer.letsme.sh/status/observers](https://analyzer.letsme.sh/status/observers)  

2. Locate your node name (for example <code>YOW_OldBarrhaven</code>) in the list.  

3. Confirm that it appears in the table and is highlighted in **green** — this means it is online and reporting correctly.  

## Notes
* This firmware publishes logs directly to the Analyzer MQTT broker — no Raspberry Pi or VM is needed.  
* The node operates as a repeater with repeating disabled, meaning it listens and reports traffic but does not forward it.  
* Make sure to report your assigned repeater ID in the Ottawa Mesh Discord to avoid overlap.
