# Getting Started with Meshtastic

Meshtastic is a peer-to-peer LoRa mesh where every node can forward packets. 
This guide will help you flash Meshtastic firmware onto your device and configure it for use in the local Ottawa mesh.

## Before You Start
To set up your first node, you’ll need:
* A supported LoRa device (see [[Meshtastic/Recommended Hardware (Canada)]])
* A USB cable for flashing
* Google Chrome browser (required for the Web Flasher)
* (Optional) The Meshtastic mobile app for iOS or Android

## Flashing a Node
The easiest way to flash a Meshtastic node is by using the official web flasher tool in Google Chrome:

[Meshtastic Web Flasher](https://flasher.meshtastic.org/)

Only **Google Chrome** supports the serial connection required for flashing.

For step-by-step instructions, see:  
[Flashing Firmware Guide](https://meshtastic.org/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/)

## Configuring Your Node
After flashing, configure your device for local use.

Follow the official guides here:  
* [Initial Configuration](https://meshtastic.org/docs/getting-started/initial-config/)  
* [General Configuration Reference](https://meshtastic.org/docs/configuration/)

When configuring your node, ensure you set the Ottawa frequency preset:  
; Preset : **US/LongFast – 906.875 MHz**

## Building a Repeater (Optional)
Meshtastic does not require special repeater nodes. 
Any stationary node left powered on will forward packets between users.

To build a reliable repeater-like node:
# Place a node high up with clear line-of-sight.
# Power it continuously (mains or solar recommended).
# Disable Bluetooth to save power and reduce interference (optional).

''Tip:'' Do ''not'' change the device role from "Client" unless you’ve consulted the community.
