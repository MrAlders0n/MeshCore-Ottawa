Because it relies on nodes that are typically moving, coverage can also be unreliable and sporadic. MeshCore relies on fixed repeaters for routing, providing a more stable and scalable backbone for city-wide coverage.

Follow each step carefully for a reliable and weatherproof build. Assembly Steps WARNING: Always ensure a LoRa antenna and the Bluetooth antenna are attached to the RAK board before powering it on. Powering without antennas can permanently damage the board. Unbox all components and place them aside. Tip: Try not to misplace the small screws and fittings \u2014 they\u2019re easy to lose. Mount the RAK backplate into the box with the four provided screws. Drill two holes: one for the N-type antenna mount and one for the drain plug. Use a step drill bit for clean holes. Finding the top of the box: Flip the box onto its back. Locate the mount hole marked \"1\" \u2014 this is the top. Drill slowly, one step at a time. Test-fit the N-type connector after each step until it fits snugly. Repeat the same process on the bottom of the box for the drain plug. Attach both the N-type antenna mount and the drain plug. Connect the N-type antenna to the LoRa IPEX connector on the RAK19003 board. Mount the Bluetooth antenna to the side of the box using the included double-sided tape.

Each section provides quick guidance for common tasks. How Adverts Work MeshCore uses a repeater-driven advert system for discovery (not a prerequisite to transmit). You do not need to have recevied an advert from a repeater to send a message. You can transmit at any time; any repeater that hears your packet will forward it. Adverts allow your node to discover repeaters (their ID and info). This enables features such as: Tracing paths to confirm connectivity Seeing repeater names in the path summary of a message Setting static paths to a specific user Repeaters periodically broadcast adverts (short beacon packets) across the mesh. In Ottawa, adverts are configured for: Zero-hop adverts (direct): Every 1 hour Flood adverts (forwarded across repeaters): Every 3 hours This approach keeps discovery traffic low while still ensuring that repeaters can be identified and messages are reliably forwarded across the mesh. The Public Channel By default, MeshCore companion nodes in Ottawa have access to the shared public channel . Any correctly flashed node set to the correct frequency can join immediately and begin passing traffic. When you send a message and a repeater hears it, you will see Heard X Repeats under your message (instead of just Sent ). You can click and hold the message, then select Heard Repeats to see which repeaters heard it. If you have discovered the repeater through adverts, you will see its name . If not, you will see only its ID . How to Share Your Contact URL Open the MeshCore app and connect it to your companion node. Tap the Signal icon at the top. [[:File:MeshCore_GetContactID1.png|\ud83d\udd17 View Screenshot]] Tap Advert \u2192 To Clipboard .

[[:File:MeshCore_TraceRoute1Hop1.png|\ud83d\udd17 View Screenshot]] You will see only a single repeater ID in the path \u2014 this indicates a 1-hop trace. You do not need to specify a return path because the trace goes directly to the repeater and back to your node.

Tap the three dots in the top-right corner (menu button). [[:File:MeshCore_TraceRoute1.png|\ud83d\udd17 View Screenshot]] Tap Tools . [[:File:MeshCore_TraceRoute2.png|\ud83d\udd17 View Screenshot]] Tap Trace Path \u2013 Manual . [[:File:MeshCore_TraceRoute3.png|\ud83d\udd17 View Screenshot]] Tap the plus button to select your repeater. [[:File:MeshCore_TraceRoute4.png|\ud83d\udd17 View Screenshot]] Select the repeaters you want to trace in order. In this menu, you can't select repeaters more than once. First, select your path to the repeater, then tap the checkmark. Go back into the add menu and select the repeaters for the return path . Alternatively, if you know the repeater IDs, you can type them directly into the path bar (comma-separated). Example: To trace from RepeaterA (ID d3 ) \u2192 RepeaterB (ID f3 ) \u2192 back to RepeaterA, the path bar would be: d3, f3, d3 [[:File:MeshCore_TraceRoute2Hop1.png|\ud83d\udd17 View Screenshot]] Verify the path bar shows both the forward and return paths.

Flashing & Configuring a Companion Node Flashing a Companion Node The easiest way to flash a MeshCore-supported node is by using the official web flasher tool in Google Chrome: MeshCore Web Flasher Only Google Chrome supports the serial connection required for flashing. Steps: Plug your device into your computer via USB. Open the MeshCore Web Flasher . Select your device hardware Select the firmware choice Companion Radio (Bluetooth) Click Enter DFU Mode . Note: Sometimes after erasing, the flash step may fail. If this happens, refresh the page, click Enter DFU Mode again, and then click Flash to retry. Click Erase Flash . Click Flash to install the MeshCore firmware. Note: Sometimes after erasing, the flash step may fail. If this happens, refresh the page, click Enter DFU Mode again, and then click Flash to retry. Configuring a Companion Node After flashing, follow these steps to set up your companion node: Pair the node with your phone or computer (usually over Bluetooth). Give the node a descriptive name (e.g. your callsign, location, or handle). Set it to the Ottawa frequency defaults: 910.525 MHz / BW: 62.5 kHz / SF7 / CR5 . Test by sending a message in the Public channel . If a repeater hears you, the message will show Heard X Repeats instead of just Sent . Tip: You may wish to disable Message Settings \u2192 Auto Reset Path . This isn\u2019t required, but many users find it helpful when testing links that aren\u2019t fully stable, as it prevents the path from constantly resetting.","title":"Meshcore_Flashcompanion"},{"location":"meshcore/meshcore_flashcompanion/#flashing-configuring-a-companion-node","text":"","title":"Flashing &amp; Configuring a Companion Node"},{"location":"meshcore/meshcore_flashcompanion/#flashing-a-companion-node","text":"The easiest way to flash a MeshCore-supported node is by using the official web flasher tool in Google Chrome: MeshCore Web Flasher Only Google Chrome supports the serial connection required for flashing.

Configuring a MeshCore Repeater Using Google Chrome, open the repeater configuration tool: MeshCore Repeater Config . After connecting to the device, navigate to [[MeshCore/Repeaters & Coverage#Ottawa Repeater IDs|Ottawa Repeater IDs]] and make sure the first two characters of your public key are not already in use. MeshCore repeater IDs are based on the first two characters of the public key . As the mesh has grown, duplicate IDs have caused routing conflicts \u2014 it\u2019s important to avoid using an existing ID. Developers are working on a long-term fix, but for now, each new repeater must use a unique ID. If required due to a duplicate ID, this is how to generate a new repeater ID There are two ways to assign a new repeater ID: Option 1 \u2013 Reflash the repeater (automatic key generation) Reflash the repeater. Follow [[MeshCore/Getting Started#Flashing a Node|Flashing a Node]] from the beginning, and make sure to Flash Erase during the process. This will generate a new random private key and therefore a new public key and repeater ID. However, it could generate a duplicate again, so please verify afterwards that your new repeater ID is unique by checking it against the [[MeshCore/Repeaters & Coverage|Ottawa Repeater ID List]]. Option 2 \u2013 Manually generate a private key (choose your own ID) If you want to choose your repeater\u2019s ID prefix manually: Visit the [[MeshCore/Repeaters & Coverage|Ottawa Repeater ID List]] and select an unused 2-digit ID. Go to mc-keygen and enter that 2-digit ID into the \u201cRepeater ID\u201d field, then click Generate Key . Scroll down and copy the value under Private Key . Open MeshCore Flasher , click Console , and select the serial device for your repeater. Run the following command, replacing with the key you copied: set prv.key Reboot the repeater. It will now use the new private key, and the public key will reflect your chosen repeater ID. Give the node a descriptive name (e.g. Callsign_R1 or a location-based name). Set an admin password for the repeater \u2014 this is required for remote management over MeshCore. Apply the Ottawa frequency defaults: 910.525 MHz / BW: 62.5 kHz / SF7 / CR5 . Click Save and reboot the node. Reconnect to the device using the configuration tool and click Send Advert . If your repeater is running correctly, you should see the advert appear on nearby companion nodes. After the repeater has been configured and discovered by your companion node, log into it via MeshCore Remote Administration and set the following advert intervals: Set Zero-hop adverts (direct) to every 1 hour. Set Flood adverts (forwarded across repeaters) to every 12 hours. Click Save . Tip: After every reboot, you must resync the repeater\u2019s clock.

Scope: This setup covers packet capture from companion nodes only . Packet capture for repeaters and room servers is supported by MeshCore but not yet documented on this page. Requirements A Debian-based operating system (Raspberry Pi OS, Ubuntu, or equivalent) A dedicated MeshCore companion node connected via USB or TCP bridge Internet access for sending packet data to analyzer servers 1. Companion Configuration Before installing, ensure your companion node is properly configured and named according to the Ottawa MeshCore naming standard. Each companion should follow the format: YOW_ For example: * YOW_Barrhaven * YOW_Centretown * YOW_Orleans This helps the MeshCore Packet Analyzer identify which area each listener belongs to and keeps the Ottawa network consistent. 2. Install Dependencies Run the following commands to update your system and install required packages: sudo apt update sudo apt install -y python3 curl git sudo apt install -y python3.12-venv 3. Install the MeshCore Decoder (Required for Auth) meshcore-decoder is required for authentication when publishing packets to the MeshCore Packet Analyzer. curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash source ~/.bashrc nvm install --lts npm install -g @michaelhart/meshcore-decoder Verify installation: which meshcore-decoder Once installed, proceed with running the MeshCore Packet Capture installer. 4. Run the Packet Capture Installer Run the official installation script: bash < (curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agessaman/meshcore-packet-capture/main/install.sh) In this example, a TCP connection was used. When prompted, you will be asked how you want to connect to your MeshCore device.

If you see: \u2717 Service failed to start it usually means the node wasn\u2019t reachable during setup. Check your TCP or Serial connection and restart the service manually: sudo systemctl restart meshcore-capture 5. Managing the System Service The installer creates a ''systemd'' service named meshcore-capture . sudo systemctl start meshcore-capture sudo systemctl stop meshcore-capture sudo systemctl status meshcore-capture sudo journalctl -u meshcore-capture -f If it fails to start, confirm: * The companion node is powered and reachable * The TCP or Serial settings in /home/<user>/.meshcore-packet-capture/.env.local are correct 6. Verifying Connection Once running, you should see packets appear in the MeshCore Packet Analyzer dashboard: https://analyzer.letsme.sh/status/observers Open the link above and use the All Regions dropdown in the top right to select your IATA region (e.g., YOW ). This will filter the view to show packet activity from your region and confirm your listener is forwarding data correctly. 7. Logs and Troubleshooting To view live logs: sudo journalctl -u meshcore-capture -f Common Issues Connection refused: Check TCP host/port meshcore-decoder not found: Re-run Step 2 No packets visible: Ensure the node is on the correct channel/frequency 8. Next Steps Future documentation will include: * Packet capture for repeaters Packet capture for room servers * 9.

Hardware falls broadly into three categories: Companion Nodes , Repeaters , and Room Servers . Companion Nodes A companion node is typically a small, personal device (often handheld or portable) that allows a user to connect into the mesh. They usually run on battery or USB power. Often paired with a smartphone over Bluetooth for messaging. There are also standalone nodes, such as the T-Deck , which include a screen and a keyboard and can operate independently without a smartphone. However, we don\u2019t recommend starting with one of these, as the firmware for them is not yet polished and can be confusing to use. * Companion nodes do not route packets between themselves. A companion node can talk directly to another companion node. Only repeaters * are responsible for routing packets across the MeshCore network. \u2192 See [[MeshCore/CompanionNodes]] for details. Repeaters A repeater is a fixed installation, usually mounted at height (e.g. rooftop, tower, or mast), that helps extend range and link mesh segments together. They run continuously on mains or solar power. In Ottawa most repeaters run off solar power. In MeshCore: repeaters form the stable, consistent backbone infrastructure of the network and are the only devices that perform packet routing. \u2192 See [[MeshCore/Repeaters]] for details. Room Servers A room server is a device flashed with specialized room server firmware that functions like a persistent chat room or old-school BBS. Stores the last 32 messages sent to it. When a companion node connects, it retrieves those stored messages, similar to checking an email inbox. While they technically can be set to repeat, this is strongly discouraged. In Ottawa, repeat has been disabled on room servers, and developers have discussed removing the option entirely. Room servers are not full repeaters \u2014 they lack many repeater features.

This guide will help you flash Meshtastic firmware onto your device and configure it for use in the local Ottawa mesh. Before You Start To set up your first node, you\u2019ll need: * A supported LoRa device (see [[Meshtastic/Recommended Hardware (Canada)]]) * A USB cable for flashing * Google Chrome browser (required for the Web Flasher) * (Optional) The Meshtastic mobile app for iOS or Android Flashing a Node The easiest way to flash a Meshtastic node is by using the official web flasher tool in Google Chrome: Meshtastic Web Flasher Only Google Chrome supports the serial connection required for flashing. For step-by-step instructions, see: Flashing Firmware Guide Configuring Your Node After flashing, configure your device for local use. Follow the official guides here: Initial Configuration General Configuration Reference When configuring your node, ensure you set the Ottawa frequency preset: ; Preset : US/LongFast \u2013 906.875 MHz Building a Repeater (Optional) Meshtastic does not require special repeater nodes. Any stationary node left powered on will forward packets between users. To build a reliable repeater-like node: Place a node high up with clear line-of-sight. Power it continuously (mains or solar recommended). Disable Bluetooth to save power and reduce interference (optional).
